XORTY

This is an xindy package to sort a text file (one entry on each line).
It uses the language-specific rules of the make-rules package.

This package contains the following:

1. A raw index filter (written in C) to transform the input text file into a
form suitable for xindy.

2. A xindy style file for formatting the output as a simple text file.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Requirements:
- C compiler
- C library which provides the getline() function (e.g. Linux)
- GNU make or an equivalent `make' program
- xindy 2.0 or higher


1. Installation

- Check the Makefile, especially the variables BINDIR and MODDIR.

- Type `make'. This builds the raw index filter.

- As root, type `make install'.


2. Testing

- Type `make test'. This will take the file xorty-test.txt and output a file
  xorty-sorted.txt, sorted according to traditional spanish sorting rules.
  For testing purposes, a raw index file xorty-test.raw is also generated.

- The contents of the sorted file `xorty-sorted.txt' should be equal to
  `xorty-sorted.cmp'. You can check this with the command
  'diff xorty-sorted.cmp xorty-sorted.txt' which should give NO output.


3. Usage

- Copy the file `example.xdy' somewhere and modify it according to your
  wishes! Simple as that!
