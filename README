MAKE-RULES

This package contains the following:

1. A Perl script to transform a description of a (language-specific)
alphabet into a set of sorting rules for xindy. Alphabets for some languages
are also provided.

2. A Perl script to generate sets of rules which are needed in combination
with the LaTeX `inputenc' package.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Requirements:
- TeX and LaTeX
- Perl 5 or higher
- GNU make or an equivalent `make' program
- If your favourite character set is not yet supported: iconv
- xindy 2.0 or higher
- Only for step 4.a): tex2xindy-noquote


1. Installation of alphabets

- Change dir to alphabets/ and check if the provided alphabets (in *.pl
  files) are according to your wishes. If you want to make modifications,
  please have a look at alphabets/test1/test1.pl.

- Check the Makefile, especially the variable INSTDIR.

- Type `make all'.

- If you additionally want to use UTF-8 encoding, also type `make utf8'.

- Type `make install'.


2. Installation of inputenc rules

- Change dir to inputenc/.

- Check the Makefile, especially the variable INSTDIR.

- Type `make all'.

- Type `make install'.

- As the `inputenc' package of TeX may change in the future, it is recommend
  to re-make these rules whenever you upgrade your TeX system.


3. Testing

- Change dir to back to the top-level directory.

- Type `make example.ind'.

- The contents of the sorted index file `example.ind' should be equal to
  `example.cmp'. You can check this with the command
  'diff example.cmp example.ind' which should give NO output.


4. Even more testing (optional)

a)
- Change dir to the inputenc/ sub-directory.

- Type `make test'. No error messages should appear.

b)
- Change dir to the alphabets/ sub-directory.

- Type `make <language>/[<variant>-]<encoding>.ind'
  (Example: make german/din5007-latin1.ind), depending on the file you want
  to check. Or type `make test' if you want to check all of them (this might
  take some time).
  
- Now check the resulting *.ind file if the sorting result is okay. If not,
  the corresponding log file (*.xlg) might give a clue as to what went wrong.


5. Usage

- Copy the file `example.xdy' somewhere and modify it according to your
  wishes! Simple as that!

- An example of mixing different languages in one index is in example-mix.xdy.
